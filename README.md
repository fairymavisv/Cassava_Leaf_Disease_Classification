## COMP9417 - Tree Leaf Classification Project

### Overview

This project focuses on classifying tree leaves using advanced deep learning models. By applying ResNet and ResNeXt models and integrating efficient optimizers, we achieved significant accuracy in leaf classification. Our approach leverages the power of PyTorch and NumPy for data preprocessing, enhancing model performance.

### Key Features

Model Application: Utilized ResNet and ResNeXt models for leaf classification.
Optimization Techniques: Implemented AdamW and SGD optimizers to enhance model efficiency.
High Accuracy: Achieved 92% accuracy using the ResNeXt50 model with SGD optimizer, validated through 10-fold cross-validation.
Data Preprocessing: Developed robust preprocessing pipelines using PyTorch and NumPy, improving model performance by 25%.
Team Collaboration: Collaborated with a team of three data scientists, using GitHub for effective version control and project management.
